# Assignment-oneThis project is a Python-based program that manages and analyzes poultry egg production data using fundamental programming concepts and data structures. It fulfills the following requirements:This Python project manages poultry egg production data using core programming concepts. It calculates totals, averages, minimum, and maximum egg counts (integers), generates formatted reports with f-strings (strings), and applies threshold checks with compound conditions (booleans). Egg counts are stored, updated, sorted, and filtered using lists, while arrays are used to handle fixed-size subsets and verify sums. Dictionaries store daily records with id, name, and value, allowing updates, deletions, and total calculations. The project integrates integers, strings, booleans, lists, arrays, and dictionaries in a real-world data management scenario.
